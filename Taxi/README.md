## 🧠 ILAI Architecture for Taxi

### Multi-Phase Planning
ILAI breaks down the taxi task into strategic phases:

1. **Passenger Location Phase**: Navigate to passenger pickup location
2. **Pickup Phase**: Execute pickup action at correct position
3. **Destination Phase**: Navigate to delivery destination  
4. **Dropoff Phase**: Execute dropoff action at target location

### Symbolic State Representation
```python
# E-A-R tuple examples
pickup_rule = {
    "Environment": "taxi_at_passenger_location",
    "Action": "pickup", 
    "Result": "passenger_in_taxi"
}

navigation_rule = {
    "Environment": "taxi_position_(2,3)_destination_(4,0)",
    "Action": "move_south",
    "Result": "progress_toward_goal"  
}
```

### BPM/WBM Integration
- **Blooming**: Generate candidate navigation strategies
- **Pruning**: Validate strategies based on success/failure outcomes
- **Bridge Construction**: Link pickup and dropoff sub-goals
- **Utility Evaluation**: Balance efficiency vs. success probability
